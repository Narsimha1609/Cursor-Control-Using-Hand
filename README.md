# Cursor-Control-Using-Hand

This project implements a virtual mouse system using hand tracking and gestures, powered by OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. The system allows you to control your computer's mouse pointer by moving your hand in front of a webcam. By using the index finger for pointer control and thumb gestures for clicks, this application creates an intuitive and touch-free experience for interacting with the computer.

Features:<br>
Hand Tracking: Tracks the user's hand in real-time using Mediapipe's hand landmark detection.<br>
Mouse Control: Controls the mouse pointer by moving the index finger.<br>
Click Gesture: Performs a mouse click when the thumb and index finger come close together.<br>
Smoothing: Implements smoothing to ensure smoother and more stable pointer movement.<br>
FPS Display: Displays the current frames per second (FPS) on the screen for performance monitoring.<br>
